# The Project

The purpose of this project is on two levels:

* The first stage, is to predict whether or not a patron will make a donation using a classifier (Naive Bayes).
* The second stage, is to predict the amount that a patron should donate given that they will make a donation (Regression).

Through these two models, we will be able to determine which patrons are prime to contact directly by a gift officer to be propositioned for a donation AND to accurately estimate how much to ask for.

This solves three problems:

1) Identifying new prospects to approach.
2) Providing a reasonable ask estimate for that particular prospect.
3) Determine how to move specific patrons who are not ready for an ask to move into that position (Example: If patron xyz were to attend one more concert, they would be 30% more likely to make a donation...)
